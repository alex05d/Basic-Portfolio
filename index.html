            <p>Hello! my name is Alexiss Diaz. I am a student at SMU Coding boot camp. As you can probably tell by my picture I love to fish! I have visited many different places in pursuit of catching the “BIG ONE”.  I have traveled to many lakes in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Florida, Key West and Mexico. By far my favorite experience is when I fought a giant stingray form a forty-foot pier. Never since then have I lost, won, and lost again with just one fish. It was truly a fishing trip to remember. I wish I could have taken a picture but alas enjoy this picture of a shark I caught on the same pier the following year.</p>
